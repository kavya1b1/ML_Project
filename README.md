üöÄ My Machine Learning Journey
This repository serves as a personal portfolio and learning hub for my Machine Learning projects, ranging from foundational concepts to more advanced applications. Each project is designed to deepen my understanding of ML algorithms, data science workflows, and practical implementation using Python.

üåü About This Repository
This repository documents my progression in the field of Machine Learning. It's a place where I:

Apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems.

Develop strong coding practices for ML.

Showcase my ability to build, evaluate, and interpret ML models.

Continuously learn and experiment with new techniques and algorithms.

Each project directory includes its own README.md with detailed explanations of the problem, data, methodology, results, and insights.
